# Project Plan

This repository collects small prototypes and notes for exploring the
"Φ-Calculus" concept.  The aim is to study how system boundaries affect
information flow across domains such as AGI safety, climate policy, and
quantum computing.  Current contents are intentionally lightweight so the
ideas can evolve incrementally.

## Current Components
- **`validation_protocol.py`** – a minimal script that generates random
tensors and tests whether predicted boundary responses correlate with
system behaviour.  It now supports multiple weighted domains to
experiment with the meta-Φ formulation.
- **`PLASMA_MEMORY.md`** – summary of laboratory results showing that
dusty plasmas can form stable Coulomb crystals with memory-like
properties.
- **`QUANTUM_CAPACITOR.md`** – theoretical sketch for a high energy
density capacitor based on coherent plasma.

## Near-Term Goals
1. **Refine the Validation Demo**
   - Add real data sources in place of synthetic tensors.
   - Explore additional perturbation models and complexity checks.
2. **Document Boundary Use Cases**
   - Track ideas on applying Φ-Calculus to AGI, climate and quantum
     domains in more detail.
   - Assess mathematical tools (Fourier Neural Operators, manifold
     learning) that could make optimisation practical.
3. **Establish Experiment Logs**
   - Keep small, reproducible code examples along with notes on the
     assumptions, metrics and outcomes.

The project is intentionally modest at this stage.  The focus is on
clarifying concepts and recording incremental progress rather than
building production software.
