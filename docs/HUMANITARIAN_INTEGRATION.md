# Humanitarian Integration Plan

This document summarizes the proposed approach for connecting the AGI-EGGS framework to existing humanitarian and government service platforms. It condenses the extensive user-provided guide into actionable notes for future development.

## Key Services and Standards
The plan identifies ten priority servicesâ€”emergency shelter, medical aid, food security, WASH, refugee registration, child protection, gender-based violence response, social protection, education access, and disaster early warning. Each service should exchange data using established standards such as FHIR, HDX, CAP, GBVIMS, or CPIMS+ to ensure interoperability.

## Technical Considerations
- **Consent and Data Sovereignty**: Implement a compliance engine that evaluates cross-border transfers and supports granular, purpose-specific consent.
- **Offline-First Sync**: Field devices must capture data offline and synchronize using priority queues once connectivity is restored. Support mesh relays, satellite fallback and SMS for critical alerts.
- **Multi-Language NLP**: Provide real-time translation and structured data extraction across common humanitarian languages to ease case intake.
- **Private Sector & Community Hooks**: Offer APIs for logistics providers, telecoms and grassroots groups so they can supply resources or validate reports during crises.
- **Zero-Trust Security**: Use end-to-end encryption, role-based access, and immutable audit logs to protect sensitive information.

## Roadmap Highlights
1. Establish core APIs and offline mobile app for case intake.
2. Add multi-language and consent features.
3. Integrate logistics and telecommunications partners.
4. Expand to predictive analytics and community peer networks.
