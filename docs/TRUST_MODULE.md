# Adaptive Trust & Verification Module

This document describes the prototype self-modifying trust framework.
It uses simple cryptographic checks and consensus voting to decide
whether proposed changes should be applied.

Features include:
- Component verification via `IntegrityScanner`.
- Distributed approval using `ConsensusEngine`.
- Change simulation through `EvolutionGovernor`.
- Basic trust level adjustment after each modification.

This is a proof-of-concept to show how AGIâ€‘EGGS could evolve while
maintaining integrity.
