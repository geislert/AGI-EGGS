# Laser-Based Satellite Control & Debris Management

This document stores a prototype for using phased laser arrays to maneuver satellites and deorbit debris. The concept was provided by the user and includes sample Python code.

Key ideas:
- Ground, lunar, and orbital laser stations coordinate to provide satellite attitude control, orbital maneuvers, power transmission, and debris nudging.
- The system uses beam splitting to allocate power between multiple functions.
- Debris objects are queued and nudged over many passes to lower perigee.

The file `laser_control.py` contains a simplified implementation with placeholder physics for demonstration.
