linking these families to ancient Roman citizens, but highlights strong
indirect cultural and linguistic impacts across Europe. Roman law, Latin
loanwords, Christian traditions, and legal systems influenced the regions where
these families lived. The report illustrates how Roman "soft power" shaped
the historical landscape even in areas never conquered by Rome.
