# Low-Cost Global Communication System

This document outlines a conceptual design for a globally accessible,
AI-managed communication network using inexpensive hardware. The plan is
based on the user's 20-point outline and is preserved here for future
implementation work.

## Core Hardware Foundation
1. **Solar-Powered Mesh Nodes** – Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with LoRaWAN and solar
   panels. Duty cycling managed by AI to conserve power.
2. **AI-Controlled HF/VHF Repeaters** – Modified radios with an Arduino board
   running a frequency-hopping algorithm.
3. **Universal Charging Backpack** – Hand-crank and solar charging with
   supercapacitors. AI prioritizes medical traffic.

## AI Communication Management
4. **Propagation Prediction Engine** – On-device ionospheric model with AR
   visualization.
5. **ALE 2.0 Scanning** – HF bands scanned periodically; channel quality
   stored in a matrix.
6. **Jamming Evasion System** – RF fingerprinting to trigger frequency hopping.
7. **AI-Driven Digital Modes** – Automatic selection of digital mode based on
   signal-to-noise ratio.

## Local AI Implementation
8. **On-Device Model Switcher** – Choose model size based on device capability.
9. **Model Zoo for Edge Devices** – Recommended models by device class.
10. **Over-the-Air Model Updates** – Peer-to-peer distribution with SHA-256
    verification.

## Resilient Networking
11. **Hybrid Mesh Protocol** – LoRa, WiFi-Direct and BLE with AI path
    selection.
12. **Store-and-Forward Post Office** – Encrypted message caching during
    outages.
13. **Satellite Fallback Gateway** – Iridium module for life-threatening
    traffic only.
14. **Acoustic Data Transfer** – Ultrasound communication for short range.

## Emergency-Specific Features
15. **War Zone Stealth Mode** – RF silence with seismic sensors and burst
    transmissions.
16. **Disaster Area Mesh Bootstrapping** – AI-coordinated node deployment in
    crisis zones.
17. **AI Signal Interpreter** – Decode flashlight Morse, tap codes and gestures.

## Testing & Deployment
18. **Hardened Field Test Kits** – Bundled hardware for rapid deployment.
19. **Chaos Engineering Suite** – Scripts to simulate disasters and signal
    jamming.
20. **Global Frequency Database** – Crowdsourced regulatory info to
    auto-configure radios.

The system should also support voice relays using on-device or remote AI
models when data connectivity is poor. This would let the network act as a
human operator across various audio bandwidths and radio conditions.
