# Strategic Enhancements Proposal

This document tracks proposed high-impact features derived from recent planning notes. These items are aspirational and have not been implemented. They serve as guidance for future contributors.

## Proposed Features

1. **Quantum-Resistant Encryption** – adopt lattice-based cryptography for sensitive data.
2. **Edge AI Processing** – deploy TensorFlow Lite models for on-device analysis of images and contamination.
3. **Disaster-Resilient Mesh Networking** – integrate LoRaWAN and battery-backed micro-servers.
4. **Predictive Need Mapping** – combine satellite imagery with ground reports to forecast crises.
5. **Blockchain for Aid Transparency** – ledger system for donations and supply tracking.
6. **AR-Assisted Field Operations** – overlay instructions for medical and infrastructure repairs.
7. **Adaptive Consent Frameworks** – context-aware permissioning for data sharing.
8. **Emotional AI Triage** – voice analysis for trauma and mental health detection.
9. **Drone Integration Suite** – coordinate supply delivery and mapping drones.
10. **Cross-Border Legal Module** – automate compliance with international regulations.
11. **Nutri-Scan Mobile Integration** – smartphone AI for nutrient estimation and crop health.
12. **Holographic Command Centers** – 3D crisis mapping with headsets.
13. **Predictive Epidemiological Model** – federated learning to anticipate outbreaks.
14. **Decentralized Storage Network** – IPFS/Filecoin for censorship-resistant data.
15. **Autonomous Supply Bots** – robotics for deliveries and inventory.
16. **Cryptocurrency Aid Channels** – instant blockchain-based cash transfers.
17. **Biometric Age Verification** – deep learning to identify children without documents.
18. **Satellite Comms Fallback** – starlink kits for emergency connectivity.
19. **3D Printing Modules** – fabricate parts for medical and shelter needs.
20. **Neural Interface Accessibility** – brain-computer interfaces for victims with disabilities.

These suggestions align with the long-term vision of AGI‑EGGS but require significant research and resources. They are recorded here so contributors can evaluate feasibility and prioritize according to humanitarian impact.
