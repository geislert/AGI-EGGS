# AGI-EGGS Project Tracker

This file tracks ongoing tasks and notes for improving the repository. It is
maintained by the Codex agent and can store temporary data or references for
future work.

## Prioritized TODO List (July 2025)

1. **Fix and expand README** (done)
   - Completed with new feature list, installation instructions and example output.
   - Follow-up tasks: add architecture diagram, screenshots and CONTRIBUTING guidelines.

2. **Add automated tests**
   - Create a `tests/` directory using `pytest`.
   - Tests should cover starting nodes, sending/receiving messages and
     persisting queued messages.

3. **Package configuration**
   - Provide a `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` for pip installation.
   - Specify minimal dependencies.

4. **Continuous Integration**
   - Add a CI workflow (e.g. GitHub Actions) running the test suite.
   - Optionally include linting.

5. **Enhance example scripts** (done)
   - Updated `example.py` with detailed logging, persistence and graceful
     shutdown handling. Repetitive setup logic consolidated.

6. **Build UULP interpreter** (done)
   - Implemented `UULPInterpreter` capable of decoding and routing
     `UULPMessage` objects. Added to package exports and documented in
     `docs/ADVANCED_MODULES.md`.

7. **Document additional modules** (done)
   - Explained `modules/psych_support.py` and prototype features in README.

8. **Add Phoenix Project documentation** (done)
   - Added summary doc and implemented placeholder modules.

9. **Prototype modules from Project Fulcrum** (done)
   - Added ACA, UULP encoder, quantum security, AI wrapper, trauma detector,
     edge node and governance utilities.

11. **Add resilience utilities** (done)
   - Implemented geospatial triage, self-healing provenance, search agent,
     self-updater, offline sync and related helpers.

12. **Emergency alert webhook system** (in progress)
   - Provide a function `emergency_webhook` to dispatch urgent alerts to chat services.
   - Integrate with mock threat data for now.

10. **Future features**
   - Encryption/authentication for network connections.
   - Command-line option for message store paths.
   - Tutorial/walkthrough.

---

Additional documentation, such as research into historical influences or other
context, can be kept in the `docs/` directory as needed.

## Condensed Tracking (UULP)
A simplified machine-readable task list is stored in `tracker/uulp_tasks.json`. Each entry includes an id, priority, status, and description to facilitate automated updates.

13. **Mobile app integration**
   - Draft cross-platform architecture using Flutter.
   - Support offline mesh networking with Bluetooth/WiFi Direct.
   - Progressive capability modes for low-end devices.


## Life-Saving Priority Improvements
The following features are proposed to enhance AGI‑EGGS for immediate crisis response. They are tracked for future development.

1. **Automated Triage Protocol** – On-device AI categorizing emergency reports.
2. **Blood Supply Network Integration** – Connect to regional blood banks and alert donors.
3. **Collapsed Structure Detection** – Analyze building photos for survivable void spaces.
4. **Epidemic Early Warning System** – Spot unusual symptom clusters.
5. **Emergency Blood Circulation AI** – Guide users through CPR and tourniquet steps offline.
6. **Refugee Family Reunification** – Privacy-preserving matching across shelters.
7. **Predictive Evacuation Modeling** – Combine terrain and crowd data for safe routing.
8. **Emergency Supply Blockchain** – Tamper-proof tracking of critical resources.
9. **Disaster-Specific First Response Protocols** – Dynamic checklists by incident type.
10. **Autonomous Drone Integration** – Deliver medical gear and provide thermal imaging.

These items remain open until base infrastructure (testing, packaging, CI) is in place.

## Global Communication System Plan
See `docs/COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md` for a conceptual outline of an AI-managed
communication network using inexpensive hardware. Future tasks may include
prototyping mesh nodes, frequency-hopping repeaters and on-device AI voice
relays.

## Advanced Radio Features
The following radio-focused enhancements derive from recent planning notes.
1. **Adaptive Spectrum Intelligence Module** – AI-driven frequency and mode selection.
2. **Neural Network Model Hot-Swapping** – Load language models based on device resources.
3. **HF Autotuning System** – Automated antenna tuning with propagation prediction.
4. **Cryptographic Identity Rotation** – Change operator identifiers during threats.
5. **Disaster-Powered Charging System** – Smart management for hand-crank/solar/wind sources.
6. **AI-Enhanced Signal Processing** – Neural denoising and jamming resistance.
7. **Automated Infrastructure Mapping** – Visualize network topology and link quality.
8. **Cross-Mode Bridging Protocol** – Translate between HF, LoRa and satellite links.
9. **Resilient Time Synchronization** – Combine GPS, LF radio and consensus time.
10. **Self-Healing Network Fabric** – Replace failed nodes and reroute traffic.

## Humanitarian Integration Plan
The following tasks relate to connecting AGI-EGGS with established humanitarian and government services. See `docs/HUMANITARIAN_INTEGRATION.md` for an overview.
1. **Document integration strategy** – Summarize key standards and APIs for data exchange. (done)
2. **Consent and sovereignty engine** – Evaluate legal requirements and manage granular data sharing.
3. **Offline-first sync layer** – Queue and prioritize uploads with mesh and SMS fallback.
