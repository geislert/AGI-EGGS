# Advanced Modules Overview

This document summarizes prototype components inspired by the Project Fulcrum report.
They demonstrate how AGIâ€‘EGGS could evolve beyond basic IoT networking.

## Architectural Conformance Agent
Enforces simplified ethical constraints in real time.

## UULP Encoder
Proof-of-concept universal translator that attaches provenance info to messages.

## Quantum Secure Communications
Uses CRYSTALS-Kyber if available with a Fernet fallback for message encryption.

## Constitutional LLaMA and Trauma Detector
Wrappers around language models to enforce ethical output and assess mental health.

## Rugged Edge Node
Describes hardware for solar-powered, EMP-hardened deployments.

## Humanitarian Data Governance
Placeholder for GDPR-compliant handling of sensitive data.

## Resilience Utilities
The `resilience` module contains a collection of experimental features focused on
emergency response and self-replacement:

- **Geospatial Crisis Triage** via `triage_by_zip`.
- **DataProvenanceManager** for anchoring dataset metadata.
- **human_like_search`** function to mimic human search patterns.
- **SelfUpdater** for sandboxed code replacement.
- **visualize_threat`** for basic threat dashboard data.
- **MeshSync** for offline-first peer synchronization.
- **MultimodalCortex** combining voice, image and text inputs.
- **moral_weight_score`** evaluating code changes.
- **JournalistVerifier** for crowdsourced media validation.
- **ZipDataPod** storing encrypted caches per ZIP prefix.
- **emergency_webhook** dispatches urgent alerts to chat services.

These modules are experimental and intended for demonstration only.
