# Advanced Modules Overview

This document summarizes prototype components inspired by the Project Fulcrum report.
They demonstrate how AGI‑EGGS could evolve beyond basic IoT networking.

## Architectural Conformance Agent
Enforces simplified ethical constraints in real time.

## UULP Encoder
Proof-of-concept universal translator that attaches provenance info to messages.

## UULP Interpreter
Decodes `UULPMessage` objects and routes them to appropriate handlers. This
prototype simply parses the modality and payload and prints the structured
result.

## Quantum Secure Communications
Uses CRYSTALS-Kyber if available with a Fernet fallback for message encryption.

## Constitutional LLaMA and Trauma Detector
Wrappers around language models to enforce ethical output and assess mental health.

## Rugged Edge Node
Describes hardware for solar-powered, EMP-hardened deployments.

## Humanitarian Data Governance
Placeholder for GDPR-compliant handling of sensitive data.

## Resilience Utilities
The `resilience` module contains a collection of experimental features focused on
emergency response and self-replacement:

- **Geospatial Crisis Triage** via `triage_by_zip`.
- **DataProvenanceManager** for anchoring dataset metadata.
- **human_like_search`** function to mimic human search patterns.
- **SelfUpdater** for sandboxed code replacement.
- **visualize_threat`** for basic threat dashboard data.
- **MeshSync** for offline-first peer synchronization.
- **MultimodalCortex** combining voice, image and text inputs.
- **moral_weight_score`** evaluating code changes.
- **JournalistVerifier** for crowdsourced media validation.
- **ZipDataPod** storing encrypted caches per ZIP prefix.
- **emergency_webhook** dispatches urgent alerts to chat services.

These modules are experimental and intended for demonstration only.

## Life-Saving Utilities
The `life_support` module groups together features aimed at direct emergency response. These functions are simple stubs demonstrating how AGI‑EGGS could assist in crisis zones:

- `triage_report` – categorize reports by severity using keywords.
- `blood_supply_alert` – notify nearby donors of shortages.
- `detect_collapsed_structure` – placeholder for analyzing building images.
- `epidemic_early_warning` – detect unusual symptom clusters.
- `emergency_procedure_guide` – provide short first-aid instructions.
- `reunify_refugee_family` – demo facial matching workflow.
- `predictive_evacuation_model` – suggest evacuation timing.
- `log_supply` – record items to a tamper-proof log.
- `disaster_checklists` – simple dynamic action lists.
- `drone_dispatch` – stub for delivering medical gear via drone.

These are purely demonstrative but show how the framework could evolve toward life-saving applications.
