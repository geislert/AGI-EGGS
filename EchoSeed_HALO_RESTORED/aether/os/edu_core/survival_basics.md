# Survival Basics: Essential Knowledge for Immediate Crises

## 1. Shelter
* Find or build cover from rain, wind, and sun.
* Use natural features (caves, dense foliage) or improvised materials (tarps, branches, scrap).
* Insulate from the ground.
* Protect against animals and insects.

## 2. Water Sourcing & Purification
* **Collection:** Collect rainwater (from leaves, tarps), dew, or melt snow/ice.
* **Sources:** Identify natural springs, streams, or pooled water. Avoid stagnant or discolored water.
* **Purification (Boiling):** Bring water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute (3 minutes at high altitudes).
* **Purification (Filtering):** Use improvised filters (layers of cloth, charcoal, sand, gravel) to remove particulates, then boil.
* **Purification (Chemical):** Use purification tablets if available.

## 3. Fire-Starting
* **Purpose:** Warmth, cooking, water purification, signaling, morale, predator deterrence.
* **Methods:**
    * **Ferrocerium Rod & Striker:** Scrape vigorously to create sparks onto tinder.
    * **Friction:** Bow drill, hand drill (requires practice).
    * **Lens:** Use a magnifying glass (Fresnel lens from HALO stick) to focus sunlight onto tinder.
    * **Battery & Foil:** Touch a 9V battery terminals with fine steel wool or gum wrapper to create a spark.
* **Tinder:** Dry fibrous material (cotton, shredded bark, bird's nest material).
* **Kindling:** Small twigs, pencil-sized sticks.
* **Fuel:** Larger branches, logs.
* **Protection:** Build fire in a sheltered area, clear debris, protect from wind.

## 4. First Aid (Basic)
* **Assess Situation:** Ensure safety for yourself and the injured.
* **ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation):**
    * **Airway:** Ensure clear airway (head tilt, chin lift).
    * **Breathing:** Look, listen, feel for breathing. If not breathing, perform rescue breaths.
    * **Circulation:** Check for pulse. Control severe bleeding immediately.
* **Control Bleeding:** Apply direct pressure to the wound with clean cloth. Elevate the injured limb. If severe, consider a tourniquet as a last resort.
* **Wound Care:** Clean wounds with purified water. Cover with clean dressing. Monitor for infection (redness, swelling, pus, fever).
* **Shock:** Keep person warm, elevate legs (if no head/spine injury), reassure.
* **Fractures/Sprains:** Immobilize injured limb with a splint. Support and elevate.
* **Hypothermia/Heatstroke:**
    * **Hypothermia:** Warm slowly (blankets, body heat, warm drinks).
    * **Heatstroke:** Cool rapidly (shade, wet cloths, fanning).

## 5. Navigation (Offline)
* **Sun Compass:**
    * **Daytime:** Sun rises in the East, sets in the West. At noon (local solar noon), the sun is highest in the sky and generally points South in the Northern Hemisphere (North in Southern Hemisphere).
    * **Stick Method:** Place a stick upright, mark its shadow tip. Wait 15 minutes, mark new tip. Draw a line between marks (East-West line). First mark is West, second is East.
* **Star Navigation:**
    * **Northern Hemisphere:** Locate Polaris (North Star) using the Big Dipper. Polaris is always North.
    * **Southern Hemisphere:** Use the Southern Cross to find South.
* **Natural Indicators:**
    * **Moss:** Often grows on the North side of trees in the Northern Hemisphere (less reliable).
    * **Wind Patterns:** Prevailing winds can indicate direction.
    * **Water Flow:** Rivers flow downhill.
* **EchoSeed HALO Assistance:** Use the device's pre-loaded vector maps, celestial navigation tools, and AI-guided urban/wilderness route planning.
