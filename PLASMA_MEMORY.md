# Plasma Memory Experiments

Recent laboratory studies demonstrate that dusty plasmas can organize into large, stable Coulomb crystals capable of retaining information. Key results include:

- **Large-scale Coulomb crystals** up to 40Ã—15 cm that remain stable under controlled conditions.
- **Three-dimensional lattice structures** such as FCC and BCC arrangements that offer different memory characteristics.
- **Viscoelastic behavior** indicating that a plasma's past states influence its present configuration.

These findings suggest plasma may be usable as a room-temperature information storage medium. See the references in the source list at the end of this file for further reading.
